### Attendance & Participation
Regular attendance and participation is both required and expected every class as much of what we will cover is not 
included in the course materials. Active participation (e.g., ask questions, provide your perspective), group conversation, 
and engagement is key to a truly effective learning and experience. I will do my best to make the course engaging 
through things like examples, in-class exercises, or use cases, and in return I ask that you remain attentive, engaged, 
and ask questions during class time.

### Homework
You will have three homework assignments focused on:
- Graph Data Modeling  
- Graph Algorithms
- Graph Machine Learning

These are designed to reinforce key concept which you will need as we build on them throughout the course. They will also
relate directly to your Project Deliverables and so completing them effectively will make life easier down the road.

### Course Project
The majority of the work in this course is centered around your course project, which can later serve as a portfolio 
piece for your work. For this project, you will choose a 
dataset and corresponding business use case which is formed around this dataset. You will have until the first project
deliverable submission to finalize your data set and use case. Be mindful of your dataset selection as it must serve you
throughout the semester. If it is too simple, it may be difficult to analyze in a multitude of ways, if it is too 
complex, it may be difficult to engineer. Students are encouraged to discuss their data and use case prior to submission
to avoid unforeseen issues down the road.

### Project Deliverables
There are four project deliverables which are due throughout the semester prior to your final project:
- Project Use Case, Data Model, and Graph Projections 
- Graph DB setup and Application of Algorithms
- Graph Visualization Use Case
- Graph Machine Learning Application

Each deliverable will require you to utilize Network Science for a different purpose to support your chosen project and
must demonstrate added value to your use case, rather than a simple demonstration of the technique. 
### Final Project
Your final project will be presented at the end of class and should feature aspects from all four project deliverables
as well as the final course topic. This project is meant to represent a business use case and should be presented as one.
Effective final project presentations should include both a cohesive data story and demonstrations of added value through 
Network Science techniques.
#### Grading
Up to 100 additional points (on top of the 200 allocated for your project grade [Yes, that's an additional 40%]) may be 
awarded to your final project presentation. This is to allow students to make up for things like a poor exam grade, 
missed homework, or an unsatisfactory project deliverable by going above any beyond on a particular section of their project.
This is totally up to the student and where they feel they can best apply their strengths. Examples include things like:
- Extensive algorithmic data analysis that provides additional support to the use case
- A detailed or interactive graph-based BI (Business Intelligence) dashboard
- Advanced application of graph machine learning techniques
